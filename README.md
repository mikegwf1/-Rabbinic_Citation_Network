Social Network Analysis of Rabbis quoting Rabbis in the Talmud

In this project we identify rabbinic citations in the Bavli Talmud and identify and analyze social networks based on these citations.  We synthesize a master list of rabbi names that exist in classic rabbinic literature of the late antiquity and use this list to tag rabbinic name references in the Talmudic text.  We then utilize  pattern matching technology to identify the various formulaic language constructs used by the Talmud to frame citations and create a MySql database of these citations.  Various subsets of these citations are imported into Gephi and UCINet for visualization and analysis.

See File_List.txt for a listing of files in project with short description of each.
